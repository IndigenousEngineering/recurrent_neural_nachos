    "# basic cnn lstm model design\n",
    "\n",
    "CNN LSTM models have more than one specific type of a \"depth\" they bring to bear on a given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "first, CNN LSTMs have a *depth of time*: think [back propogation through time (BPTT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation_through_time \"back propogation through time\") and/or truncated back propogation through time (TBPTT).\n",
    "\n",
    "CNN LSTM models also have a *depth of space*, with their multiple layers--convolutional, pooling, lstm etc--creating a deep, highly specialized and memory-persistent network.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*[CNN LSTMs are] a class of models that is both spatially and temporally deep,\n",
    "and has the flexibility to be applied to a variety of vision tasks involving sequential\n",
    "inputs and outputs*\n",

    ">â€” Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition and Description, 2015\n",
    "\n",
    "in CNN LSTM architecture, convolutional neural networks act as encoders, effectively translating visual imagery into vector space--such that an LSTM RNN can effectively process it.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs \"in the wild\" (as it were) are usually designed to process a single image at a time. however, with a few adjustments they can provide effective encoding for visual time sequence data--like video.\n",
    "\n",
    "of course, time series problems are perfect for cells with longer-term \"memory\", like LSTMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "in this notebook, we'll use a visual time series problem--specifically, the task of captioning a simple video--to illustrate the `keras` api for CNN LSTM model design."
